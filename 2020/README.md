# Advent-of-Code-2020

This repository is for the 2020 Advent of Code challenges, available at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/2020) 

I plan to attempt this year's challenges in Rust, but after fighting with rust
on day 1 part 1, I might switch back to python, or not depending on whether I can understand borrowing.

I think I am going to do the rest in python as the string handling in python is really useful.
